# Performance
## Trick 1
Custom Cargo.toml file, which specifies the customizations. 
Slower compilation, but better optimisation. (If I only have to compile once, why not take the extra speed ;p)
## Trick 2
- Using Rust as programming language
- Using reference instead of copies
# Build 
- To build and run the release version use `cargo r -r` (for windows install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
# Running the latest build
The last build has been placed in the root, and can be run by just clicking or running `impasse.exe` in the console
